## deep learnig algorithem on Telecom churn dataset 
# Steps:
1. EDA
2. Scaling
3. spliting the dataset into train and test
4. creating a Neural Networl



* Multi neuran classification ie binary classification
* here we are using sigmoid activation fuction as it is as classification problem
* model is using a sgd ie Stochastic gradient Desecnt
