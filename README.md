## deep learnig algorithem on Telecom churn dataset 
# Steps:
1. EDA
2. Scaling
3. spliting the dataset into train and test
4. creating a Neural Networl



* it is Multi neuran classification ie Binary classification problem so,
* Here we are using Sigmoid activation fuction as it is as classification problem
* In this model is using a sgd i.e. Stochastic gradient Desecnt
